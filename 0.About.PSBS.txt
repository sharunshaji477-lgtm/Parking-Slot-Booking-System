## 📌 Problem Statement
Manual parking slot booking systems are inefficient and prone to errors. This project provides a graphical user interface that allows users to book parking slots easily while storing booking details permanently in a database.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a Java-based Parking Slot Booking System that demonstrates:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Java Swing GUI
- Exception Handling
- Multithreading
- Database Connectivity using SQLite (JDBC)

---

## ✨ Features

- User-friendly GUI using Java Swing
- Book parking slots (Car / Bike)
- Displays confirmation:  
  **"Slot X is booked and saved in database!"**
- Stores booking details permanently in SQLite database
- Prevents double booking
- Input validation with error messages
- Background processing using multithreading
- Clean and modular code structure

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

- **Abstraction** → Abstract class `ParkingSlot`
- **Inheritance** → `CarSlot` and `BikeSlot`
- **Polymorphism** → Overridden method `getSlotType()`
- **Encapsulation** → Slot booking status managed inside class
